# Topic
For this lab, I decided to research the difference between the 3 UW campuses. For the search parameters, I used "UW Seattle", "UW Tacoma", and "UW Bothell". I wanted to take a look at the differences between the 3 campuses because when people think of UW they automatically think of the main campus, Seattle. However, the bothell and tacoma location also are very beautiful and unique when it comes to things from education to location. For my word clouds, I decided to make them all school themed since that is my topic.
