For this lab, I decided to research the difference between the 3 UW campuses. For the search parameters, I used "UW Seattle", "UW Tacoma", and "UW Bothell". I wanted to take a look at the differences between the 3 campuses because when people think of UW they automatically think of the main campus, Seattle. However, the bothell and tacoma location also are very beautiful and unique when it comes to things from education to location. For my word clouds, I decided to make them all school themed since that is my topic. Something that I observed when comparing the 3 word clouds was that the location, the word "university", and the word "student" are included and one of the most common words. Something that I noticed was different was the theme of words in each word cloud. What I mean by this is each word cloud has its own vibe to it. A way that my research could improve in the future is by using the words "university of Washington" instead of just "uw" when searching for the videos. Before getting the data back, I had a feeling that this would be the results for each word cloud. I have been to all 3 UW campuses and the words that are being displayed is what I would expect when discribing each location.
